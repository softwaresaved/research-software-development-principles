# Research Software Development Principles

## Background
In 2015 the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) formulated the 
[Sustainable Development Goals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainable_Development_Goals) or Global Goals 
as a collection of seventeen interlinked objectives designed to serve as a "shared blueprint for peace and prosperity 
for people and the planet, now and into the future". They emphasise the interconnected environmental, social and 
economic aspects of sustainable development by putting sustainability at their centre. This future global development 
framework aims to guide decision making, goals, and indicators to measure progress, and unify disparate efforts around 
shared goals. 

As a guiding framework,the Software Sustainability Institute have discussed developing a similar small set of 
goals / principles that we and others can adopt and implement. The idea is that the sustainable development of 
research software is multi-faceted, and therefore cannot be tackled by addressing a single goal or approach, 
or by a single project or organisation. What we are aiming for is a short set of goals we believe every research 
software project should strive for, that if many projects and organisations collectively adopted them, would make 
research software better for all - what makes research software development “societally good”.
