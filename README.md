# Research Software Development Principles
Contact @npch

The [Research Software Development Principles](principles.md) are a short set of goals we believe every research software project should strive for, 
that if many projects and organisations collectively adopted them, would make research software better for all. 

They were first released at the 2023 Research Software Engineering Conference (RSECon23).
